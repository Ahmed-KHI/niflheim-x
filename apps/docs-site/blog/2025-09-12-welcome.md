# Welcome to Niflheim-X

We're excited to introduce **Niflheim-X** - the lightweight, fast AI agent framework that's 1000x lighter than LangChain while maintaining the same power and functionality.

## Why We Built Niflheim-X

Building AI agents shouldn't require mastering complex frameworks with hundreds of dependencies. We created Niflheim-X to solve this problem:

- **âš¡ Lightning Fast**: 50ms startup vs LangChain's 2-5 seconds
- **ðŸª¶ Ultra Lightweight**: 50KB vs LangChain's 50MB
- **ðŸŽ¯ Production Ready**: Only 3 core dependencies
- **ðŸ”§ Developer Friendly**: Intuitive API design

## Getting Started

```python
from niflheim_x import Agent, OpenAIAdapter

agent = Agent(
    llm=OpenAIAdapter(api_key="your-key"),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
    memory_backend="dict"
)

response = await agent.chat("Hello!")
```

## What's Next

We're working on:
- Enhanced multi-agent orchestration
- More LLM provider integrations
- Advanced memory backends
- Enterprise features

Stay tuned for more updates!
